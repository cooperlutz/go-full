# Deploy

*Minor deviation from [`/deployments`](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout/tree/master/deployments) as both visually (length of dir name), and semantically, `deploy` is more action oriented and brief.

IaaS, PaaS, system and container orchestration deployment configurations and templates (docker-compose, kubernetes/helm, mesos, terraform, bosh).

Relevant Project Tooling:

- docker / docker compose
- azd (Azure Developer CLI)
