# Making the Grade: Decompose

Decompose the domain into sub-domains - loosely-coupled parts of the domain.

![Decomposed Domain Story](./_img/kata_domain_story_decomposed.drawio.png)

In reviewing the Domain Story defined during the [Discover phase](./2_kata_discover.md), we identify the boundaries around parts of the system that contain commonality amongst types of entities and their attributes

## Applying Independent Service Heuristics

Next, we'll apply the concept of [Independent Service Heuristics](./_templates/independent_service_heuristics.md) to our various subdomains / bounded contexts to help us validate and/or identify any gaps in our defined subdomains.
