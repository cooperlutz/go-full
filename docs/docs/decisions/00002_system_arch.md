# 00002: System Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In context of developing the system, a general architectural approach needs to be defined. This decision will guide the overall project development.

## Decision

The chosen architectural decision is to adopt a modular monolith architecture, adhering to principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

### Implementation

- System *Modules* will be defined based on bounded contexts identified through Domain-Driven Design practices.
- Each *module* will be encapsulated across each layer of the application (e.g., presentation, application, domain, infrastructure) and be capable of being extended, removed, or replaced with minimal impact to other modules.

## Alternatives Considered

- Microservices: While microservices offer scalability and independent deployment, they introduce significant complexity in terms of inter-service communication, data consistency, and operational overhead. Given the current project scope, this complexity is unwarranted.

## Consequences

If the system were to need improved scalability, highly complex logic within an individual module, or require independent deployment cycles for different parts of the system, a shift to microservices architecture may be reconsidered.
