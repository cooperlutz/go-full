# 00001: Core Logic

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Within the context of the overall system being developed, a programming language is required to support our core logic and the application implementation of the system.

## Decision

Go will be used as the programming language for the core logic and application implementation of the system.

## Alternatives Considered

None.

## Consequences

The decision to use Go will have several consequences:

- **Performance**: Go is known for its high performance, especially with concurrency support through goroutines
- **Type Safety**: Go is a statically typed language, which helps catch errors at compile time and improves code reliability.
- **Simplicity**: Go's syntax is simple and easy to understand, which will help in maintaining the codebase and onboarding new developers.
- **Community**: Go has a strong and active community, which means we can easily find support, resources, and best practices.
