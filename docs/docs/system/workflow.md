## DORA Metrics

DORA Metrics can be used to measure the performance of software development teams. The four key metrics are:

1. **Lead Time for Change**: The time it takes to go from code committed to code successfully running in production.
2. **Deployment Frequency**: How often an organization successfully releases to production.
3. **Change Failure Rate**: The percentage of changes that result in a failure in production.
4. **Time to Restore Service**: How long it takes to recover from a failure in production.

In order to measure our development performance, a self-assessment based on the DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) Quick Check has been conducted. View the results of the assessment [here](https://dora.dev/quickcheck/?leadtime=5&deployfreq=6&changefailure=10&failurerecovery=5&v=2024&industry=all&ci=55555&arch=444555&culture=555555&step=priorities#results).
